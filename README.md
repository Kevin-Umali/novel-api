## Using Version 1 (v1) of the API

For those who are still interested in using version 1 of my API, it remains accessible and functional. You can find all the relevant documentation and resources for version 1 at the following GitHub branch: [Novel API v1](https://github.com/Kevin-Umali/novel-api/tree/v1).

Please note that while v1 is still available, it may not receive the same level updates, or feature enhancements as the latest version. I encourage users to use to the current version for the most up-to-date features and improvements.
